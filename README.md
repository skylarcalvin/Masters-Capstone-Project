# Masters-Capstone-Project

This was the final product of my masters degree capstone project. It is an R Shiny application showcasing an analysis of KCPD Crime Databetween 2016 and 2019. In the project I used a Poisson distribution to forecast hotsposts of crime around Kansas City using crime data, and census data from the U. S. Census Bureau.
